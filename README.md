# üöÄ Running Flex Programs

Flex is a powerful tool for generating scanners: programs that recognize lexical patterns in text. Use this guide to quickly start running Flex programs on Windows.

## üì• Download Flex Tool

First, you need to download the Flex tool for Windows:

- **Download here**: [Flex Windows (Lex and Yacc)](http://www.technorange.com/wp-content/uploads/Flex%20Windows%20%5BLex%20and%20Yacc%5D.exe)

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Usage

Follow these steps to set up and run your Flex programs:

### Step 1: Open Flex Tool

Once downloaded, open the Flex tool.

### Step 2: Create a New File

Create a new file by selecting the "lex" option.

### Step 3: Enter Your Lex Code

Paste your Lex code into the new file and save it with the `.l` extension. Ensure you select "All Files" as the file type.
